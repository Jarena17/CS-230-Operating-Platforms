# CS-230-Operating-Platforms


# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Our client, The Gaming Room, wants to develop a web-based game only available in an Android app. The game serves multiple platforms on their current game, “Draw it or Lose it.” In the game, drawings are fully completed at the 30-second mark. If a team does not guess the puzzle before time expires. Then the other teams are allowed 15-seconds to make one guess each to solve the puzzle.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I wrote a recommendation on the most suitable host operating system, memory and storage management techniques, and communication between the server and client via API.


# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram was a great tool to help me understand the layout. It gave me a visual on the architecture and design of the program

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would try find a better way to render the images so there is zero latency. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to understand the needs of the user because the point of programming is to make it easy and simple for the end user to interact with the interface. If a program is built without considering the end user’s needs, then they probably won’t use the program you built.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I implemented a singleton pattern, which creates an object while making sure that only single object gets created to ensure the end users’ game id or team name doesn’t appear in the same game.
